Project: Recipes

This Recipes project is my first proper project with HTML.
Within this project I was able to build a website with multiple different pages which showed different recipes. This project helped me practice structuring HTML documents using headings,lists and links.
By the end of this project I was able to reinforce my understanding of file orgnanistaion and navigation within a website.
