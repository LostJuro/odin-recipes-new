        <p>This is a very easy, but elegant, baked chicken breast recipe that looks like you've spent hours in the kitchen when you've barely lifted a finger! </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in a large baking dish.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
